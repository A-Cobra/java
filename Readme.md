# Java Projects Showcase

This repository contains several Java projects that showcase different Java technologies and concepts. The projects are mostly developed under a CLI or console interface.

## Projects

### Algorithms and Data Structures

This project is a US capital questions learning game that uses TreeMaps and Java collections. The game presents the user with a series of US state names and asks the user to enter the corresponding capital city. The game keeps track of the user's score and provides feedback on each answer. This project demonstrates the use of Java collections and data structures to implement a simple game.

### Hibernate

This project is a user management system developed with Hibernate. The system allows users to create, read, update, and delete user records. This project demonstrates the use of Hibernate to perform CRUD operations on a database.

### JPA CRUD

This project is similar to the Hibernate project, but it focuses more on JPA development. It provides a simple user management system with CRUD operations, using JPA annotations to map Java classes to database tables. This project demonstrates the use of JPA for database persistence.

### SLF4J

This project is a car garage events simulation that uses SLF4J for logging. The simulation tracks events that take place in a car garage, such as adding a car to the garage or moving a car to a new location. The project demonstrates the use of SLF4J as a logging facade and Logback as an underlying logging implementation.

### Snake Game

This project is a classic snake game built using the Swing library. The game allows the user to control a snake and eat food to grow longer. The game ends if the snake runs into a wall or its own body. This project demonstrates the use of the Swing library to create a simple game.
